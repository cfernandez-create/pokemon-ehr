# Pokécenter EMR

Pokécenter EMR is an application that emulates electronic health records used in hospitals, with a delightful twist! In this app, users are able to admit Pokémon, cure statuses, heal their HP, and then discharge them. It provides an intuitive and fun way to engage with your favorite Pokémon while simulating a health care experience.

The application is built using a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js, and Node.js). It leverages the power of the PokeAPI to get sprites and commonly shared Pokémon stats like type, species, height, and weight.

## Features

- Admit Pokémon to the Pokécenter.
- Cure the status of each admitted Pokémon.
- Heal the HP of the Pokémon.
- Discharge Pokémon once they are healed.
